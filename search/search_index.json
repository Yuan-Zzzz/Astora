It provides a way to create and manage nodes, which can represent various elements such as scenes, objects, scripts, and more. Nodes can have parent-child relationships, allowing for hierarchical organization and inheritance of properties and behaviors. In Astora Engine, everything is a node, including scenes, objects, scripts, and even the engine itself. This allows for a consistent and unified approach to managing different components of the engine.</p>"}]}
