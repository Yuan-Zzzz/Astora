# Welcome to Astora Engine
## What is Astora Engine
The Astora Engine is designed to enhance the development efficiency of game developers. 
It focuses on 2D game development, uses the C# programming language, and is built on MonoGame.

!!! waring Astora Engine now is building with my own game.That means it will bring broken changes
## Desgin Philosophy 
Its design philosophy lies in enabling quick switching between two modes: pure code development and editor-based development. 

So you can use Astora Engine to build your own game whit pure C# code.Then you can use editor to do some visual edit.After using the editor, you can completely abandon it and continue developing solely through pure code.
## Who is suitable?
- Skilled C# Programmer
- Basic knowledge of MonoGame/FNA/XNA
- Prefers pure code (occasional visual editor aid)
- Focusing on GameDev, Not for Tools
