The Astora Engine is designed to enhance the development efficiency of game developers. It focuses on 2D game development, uses the C# programming language, and is built on MonoGame. Its design philosophy lies in enabling quick switching between two modes: pure code development and editor-based development. After using the editor, you can completely abandon it and continue developing solely through pure code.
